## ðŸ“Œ Included Methods

| Method                   | File                         | Description                                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Doolittle & Crout LU     | `Dolittle & Crout.py`        | Performs LU decomposition using two techniques. |
| LU via Gaussian Elim.    | `LU_gaussian.py`             | Uses Gaussian Elimination with pivoting.        |
| Scaled Partial Pivoting  | `scaled_partial_pivoting.py` | Enhanced Gaussian Elimination with scaling.     |

Each script is designed to be easy to follow and includes **intermediate print statements** to help visualize the steps in the algorithm.
